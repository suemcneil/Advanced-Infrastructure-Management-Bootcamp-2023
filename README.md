# Advanced-Infrastructure-Management-Bootcamp-2023
This site includes course materials for the Advanced Infrastructure Management Bootcamp offered in 2023

This course provides opportunities for students interested in infrastructure management, civil infrastructure systems, and asset management to gain in-depth knowledge of the infrastructure and asset management and develop project experience using real-world data. Advanced infrastructure management focuses on the methods, tools and processes needed to manage physical assets, particularly transportation assets. Topics include performance and level of service, data management, deterioration modeling, sensors and instrumentation, economics and finance, risk analysis and reliability, decision making & optimization, research methods, and soft skills. The selected topics are taught as modules (each approximately 6 hours with 3 hours of synchronous instruction and 3 hours of asynchronous activity) by instructors from universities in the United States, Canada and Chile. Readings are provided and exercises provide hands-on experiences. Students will be required to complete homework assignments and a group project.
